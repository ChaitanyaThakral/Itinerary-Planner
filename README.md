**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
As an international student with a passion for travel, I often find myself needing to return to my home country during the holidays. However, managing my travel plans can be quite challenging. Currently, I either jot down notes in an unorganized manner or store them in various folders on my laptop, which makes it difficult to keep track of everything. Creating a checklist becomes cumbersome, especially when I have to manually delete items once I've packed them. Therefore, a Travel Itinerary Planner will be a great tool to tackle these problems.
