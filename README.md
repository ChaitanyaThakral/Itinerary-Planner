**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
As an international student with a passion for travel, I often find myself needing to return to my home country during the holidays. However, managing my travel plans can be quite challenging. Currently, I either jot down notes in an unorganized manner or store them in various folders on my laptop, which makes it difficult to keep track of everything. Creating a checklist becomes cumbersome, especially when I have to manually delete items once I've packed them. Therefore, a Travel Itinerary Planner will be a great tool to tackle these problems.

Fri Nov 29 12:54:11 PST 2024: The Budget Analysis for the requested Day with Budget limit and Current Expenditure was displayed

# Phase 4: Task 3
The consoleUI class currently has many methods which are performing a lot of computation in that class, like overBudget() the method is performing the computation to check if the user is over or under budget when in reality it should be the reponsibity of the Budget class to do that. It just makes the code more lengthy and less efficient. To refactor this we can try to refactor this function into the budget class where the budget class can take the input day as parameter and find the budget analysis for that day. By this way the Budget class can handle the budget checks and return a boolean indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or not.This change will improve the code by keeping each class focused on its own taskâ€”ConsoleUI on user interaction and Budget on budget-related calculations.

The consoleUI class also has removeItem() method which is performing the action of removing the item from the checklist. This is not actually the responsibility of the consoleUI as console should just perform the action interaction with the user. We can refactor the method into checklist class although we have some methods which perform the action of removing they don't actually return the name of the item removed. So by refactoring this method into checklist class and returning the string of the item to be removed we can refactor this method. And only the printing of the removed item takes place in the ConsoleUI class.
